# Personal-Notes

This repository is for keeping all the notes of various courses that we complete. 
Please do contribute your notes too, which can surely help gain knowledge for everyone.


Rather than just having the personal notes, you can contribute the resources for individual topics that you found useful but please make sure that youb have read it and found it useful rather than just scraping the net and adding random stuff.
